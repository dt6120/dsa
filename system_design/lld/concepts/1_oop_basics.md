# OOP Basics

### Classes and Objects
- Class is a blueprint or template that defines implementation of an object.
- Object is an instance of the class.

### 1. Encapsulation
- It is hiding the implementation of object and exposing only necessary functionality through public methods.

### 2. Inheritance
- It allows a child class to inherit methods and properties of a parent class.
- Child class can reuse or override the inheritted methods.
- C++ has 3 types of inheritance: public, protected, private (default).

### 3. Polymorphism
- It is the ability of an object to take on mulitple forms.
- It can be achieved through subclass method overriding parent class implementation.

### 4. Abstraction
- It is the concept of showing only necessary information to the outside world while hiding unnecessary details.
- A class is abstract if it contains atleast one abstract/pure virtual function.
- An abstract class object cannot be instantiated directly and the subclass inheritting an abstract class must implement the virutal functions.
